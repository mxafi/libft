# libft

Libft is an individual project at Hive Helsinki that requires us to re-create
some standard C library functions and add our own. Hive does not allow
students to use most standard C library functions.

By having to implement these basic functions, I have gained a deeper and less abstract understanding
of basic data structures, algorithms, and memory management.



Please note that my code is not the best, but it has passed all of the tests that I,
my peers, and others from the internet have come up with successfully.

Use my code at your own risk.
